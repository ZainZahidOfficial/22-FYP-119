# 22-FYP-119 (SignLink)
Final Year Project for Program BS Computer Science at National Textile University, Faisalabad. 

Project Title: SignLink

Description:

People with deaf-mute disability find it difficult to communicate with normal hearing people without the help of a sign language interpreter. This project focuses on removing the barrier of communication between normal hearing and deaf/mute people. There are different sign language apps available, but they lack many features. Our sign language app is multi-purpose which can be used for both sign language interpretation in real-time and for learning sign language. 

The main feature our app “Sign Link” is to translate the sign language in real time by mobile camera using machine learning (ML) such that it can act as a medium of conversation between normal and deaf-mute people. It can combine different letters to make a meaningful word and then can spell out that word.

1.Install the Andriod Studio.

2.Install Java script, python in the Android Studio.

3.Now open the code folder and run the project.
